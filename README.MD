## Overview

SMaRT (Sensation Mapping and Reporting Tool) is a scientific app for Android-based tablet PCs. It is used for the objective documentation of bodily or somatic sensations, such as tingling, fullness, warmth, etc., with the help of a digitally annotatable human body outline.
Patients or clinical personnel mark the quality, location, extent, and intensity of the sensation on the body outline. This information is stored locally on the mobile device and can be exported if desired.
